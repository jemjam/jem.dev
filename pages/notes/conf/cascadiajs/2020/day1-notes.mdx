**i18n | l10n - The Principles for a More Accessible Web**

In the side chat there was some discussion about how nice his presentation was
and some links to tools like [mmhmm.app](https://www.mmhmm.app/) or
[Loom](http://loom.com/)

-   Good example of using css to enable some l10n.
-   Asked question: what is the diff between `i18n` / `l10n`
-   Intl.DateTimeFormat
-   Intl.ListFormat _ DisplayNames _ Temporal (you may not need js libs)
-   [Increment has a great issue](https://increment.com/internationalization/)
    dedicated to i18n/l10n  
    https://www.igalia.com/contact/ https://tc39.es/proposal-temporal/docs/ This
    episode has some good stuff: https://changelog.com/jsparty/140 Also - tc39
    is run on GH, so I would imagine you could have conversations there:
