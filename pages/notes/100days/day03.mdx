[#100DaysOfProjects](./)

Day number three and I'm starting to get nervous already. There's not much here,
so every day I share I'm a little embarassed by what's _not_ here yet. (Some of
my writing has really been unfiltered too... perhaps I'm just unpracticed.)

On top of that, I felt like today was a long day (work wise) already, so doing
anything extra feels laborious right now. But I imagine this is far from the
first time I'll be feeling this way during the project.

Digital permaculture seems to be best achieved via consistent and sustainable
cultivation. I'm trying to worry less about what's unfinished and focus more on
what I can put out there **today**.

## Today's Clippings üçÉ

-   Misc thoughts and fears above
-   Updating the template a little more. Just some minor fixes so the vertical
    align doesn't lead to unnecessary scrollbars or clipping.
-   Added a header component (with just a logo, next a menu?)
-   It's a little gross how I load the default template currently (a layout
    manually imported in every mdx file) but I also like that everything is
    encapsulated. It's getting the job done for now!
