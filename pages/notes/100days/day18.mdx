Adding little extras to css as I figure out where and how I want the main files
to be laid out. I've been shifting some of the components around a little bit
and forming some thoughts around potentially a handful of top level site folders
that should be considered, including:

-   `components`: A collection of all the individual page components that can be
    composed and make up the site
-   `layouts`: Layouts can be added to mdx pages to toggle the **wrapper**
    component. If we treat all layouts as a collection of composed components
    (with a content area) then we can mix and match and facilitate all sorts of
    strange page structures.
-   `pages`: And then pages are just documents with potentially additional
    metadata. Pages can set a wrapper layout, or import components to be used
    within the body of the page.

I've also been thinking about the layout of pages in general. If you allow for
individual pages to have their own layouts, it's likely that you still want
elements of the site (header/footers) to wrap those unique layouts. But
individual pages might also have their own (header/footer). A "site" is going to
have many "pages" within it, but the root level branding is usually still "site
wide". (This is mostly just me noting that I need to refactor some of the
components to make things more obvious.)

## Expectations

One funny element to trying to get a little bit done day over day: I find that I
can work for hours on elements and still feel like I haven't managed to complete
them properly. This leads to me feeling like I'm not getting anything done.
Which is absolutely silly, because when I look back at the commit for today I'm
definitely glad to be making progress. (The clippings below have a few points I
would have written off if not for striving to document some of today's actions.)

Being open is really challenging for me. There's a little voice in the back of
my head: "it's not as much progress as you could have made; there are so many
projects you could have pushed forward if only you could have done just a little
more... nobody cares about this incomplete increment"

I almost didn't want to commit/push and get today's increment up. Mostly just
because the progress doesn't feel substantial or worth commenting on.

But the show must go on. Trying to work in the open means putting this out
there, and just iterating. And it may be a work in progress, but there _is
progress_ day over day. That's what I'm focusing on: the baby steps, the
individual increments that make things even just a little better than they were
the day before.

Both in my code, and in life...

## TODO:

-   [ ] I'd like to have `< prev` and `next >` links somewhere on these pages,
        connecting between each of the days.
-   [ ] Need to get dark and light modes going again, it's not great to have
        light theme for folks wanting dark mode
-   [ ] Fonts: I want to keep the page load light, but I'm wondering if maybe
        something easy like Open Sans is worth the effort? (Or if nothing else,
        I should tune the system font stack a bit so I'm not just using
        `sans-serif`)

<Clippings>

-   Plop addition: I added to the plop-file enough logic to verify the latest
    highest 100days posts so I could run the script on any given day and have
    the value default to n+1 (n being the previous highest increment).
-   Giving a css gradient background a spin: this is temporary and will
    eventually toggle along with other theme settings
-   Fixed some layout issues on shorter screens. The header has a max-height
    that is to restrictive at very short pages (but necessary for vertically
    centering the content otherwise).
-   Wrote some thoughts above on feeling inadequate.
