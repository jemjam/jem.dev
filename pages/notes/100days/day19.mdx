Opened up OBS and my gaming computer for the first time in a few months (then
mostly just ran updates and reconfigured sources for updated hardware.

I've streamed before. Not too many times, but enough that I have an idea how all
the hardware and software has to be set up. I've been thinking about working on
a stream again so I spent a little bit on this Sunday afternoon hooking
everything up.

Only hang up today was that my primary (decent) webcam doesn't really run well
through some of my usb hubs into windows. (It works fine through said usb hubs
into my OSX systems, but the stream is choppy af, broken and delayed when I try
to connect to the windows streaming system.) The last time I seriously streamed
I wasn't using some of this gear, so it makes sense I'd have to figure out how
to configure it. 

I was able to eventually work around the problem by hooking the webcam in
directly to the tower (and this might be the right approach for stream
stability ultimately). It makes it just slightly harder to switch that camera
over to the laptop if I want to go back and forth...

For the context of streaming though, this shouldn't be a blocker. I plug in
directly and I'm good to go, so here's to planning some code streams in the near
future...

-   Summarize what we did today!
-   Hooked up my webcam and some of my new audio hardware to my streaming
    desktop computer
-   Immediately ran into difficulties trying to connect through some of my usb hubs
-   Switching to a direct connection seems to work for now: explored various OBS
    settings in preparation for potentially streaming soon.
