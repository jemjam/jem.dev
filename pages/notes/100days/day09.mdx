[#100DaysOfProjects](./)

Monday: working on filling in some of the gaps for the last couple of days, and
taking responsibility for not posting. We post today!

Even though I think I've made little bits of progress day over day, I haven't
felt good enough about them to share it out. Even tonight, I went in boldly a
few hours ago thinking I could fix a few pieces of content and update
everything. And here it is: 9pm (NOTE: late for me) and I still haven't quite
pushed my code from three days ago yet.

I wonder a lot about whether I'm just too exhausted to take on challenges like
this. I'm having a hard time with working into my evening: taking time away from
myself that I'm used to having just for relaxing (and dumb things like video
games) has FELT difficult. On the weekend I'm used to spending a certain amount
of time tooling about my house taking care of cleaning and chores. I'm certain
my partner's felt my lack of effort on the chore front while I pour myself into
various froms of hustle.

I also wonder a lot about whether I should be so emo in these log entries. I'm
aware this might be a tendency in my writing, to focus on _aspects of my
feelings_ rather than deliver content that is helpful to my readers. (On the
other hand: sometimes sharing a feeling is what's needed for someone else
feeling the same thing to open up.) Long term I think I'll plan to move some of
this more personal struggle to a side / personal blog. But in the meantime:
having only a single outlet means I'll just keep this here. (Message me if you
think this is a mistake, or also if you support it!)

Anyways: I'm trying not to beat myself up too much over what I do or don't
accomplish for this challenge. I do see value in trying to get a little further
every day, and have managed to make a little progress even if I haven't posted.
I just need to practice doing it more in the open.

I gotta send post before I think too much about this...
