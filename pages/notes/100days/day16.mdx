}

Today was my second (and last) day of Cascadia 2020. My main focus for the day
was tuning in and capturing key notes or links.

## Closing conference thoughts

I also decided to move all my conference notes into a designated space. I figure
I'll share notes from conferences again in the future, so I've opted to create a
little space under `/conf` to store conference notes and retrospectives.
Cascadia notes specifically are in
[/conf/cascadiajs/2020](/conf/cascadiajs/2020).

As I've been posting day over day, I've found there's still a little bit of
overhead with how I've built the site so far. (Having to import default layouts
isn't ideal and I think I can just use the default `wrapper` to provide
_default_ layout). Plus I want to get proper social media "cards", get web
mentions working, actually add some of the post metadata, actually add some more
styling...

## No Info Product (temporarily)

So much to do in fact, that I've had to admit that I don't think I'm going to
finish my info project (at least not before Friday). That work isn't lost, and I
haven't given up, but it's not my priority or stress to try to finish it _this
week_. I'm going to focus instead on fortifying some of this web property over
the next couple of days/weeks first, then I'll give it a second shot once I have
a space I feel ~~good~~ _slightly better_ about sending folks to. :sweat_smile:

## Top of mind stuff to address:

-   [ ] Social media cards so when I share links it's not so plain
-   [ ] Styling. Oh boy do I need some spacing/theming.
-   [ ] Curate the homepage / root pages a little more (put something more
        relevant than just a simple header)
-   [X] Shouldn't _have to_ import layouts (allow the `wrapper` to take care of
        defaults)
-   [X] But definitely still allow layouts to be overridden.

I'm still figuring out the best combination of modules to facilitate all of
this, but I think once I address these couple of use cases I'll have a pretty
good understanding of how to feed data into an mdx based page.

<Clippings>

-   Took lots of notes during the conference day two
-   And since I've done this one day, I have a better process for importing
-   Thinking longer term about posting conference notes directly, I'd like to
    have a spot for them to go. Thinking **too much** about long term url
    structure, I settled on `conf/cascadiajs/2020` as a spot to keep the notes
    (so I'm not just linking to `day15/16`)
-   Fixed one issue with the site build so my babel imports didn't cache
    strangely, and updated few templates and links
-   Drafted a few ideas (just above) about what some of my next garden add-ons
    should be focused toward. It's a garden, so this is always organic, but
    those seem like worthy add-ons.
