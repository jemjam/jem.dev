I've decided to start the 100days challenge, if ONLY because I've thought about
building something for awhile and always get caught up trying to plan too much.
Lately the lesson that seems to come back at me again and again is to just get
something out there, ship _anything_. If it comes out so-so you can always
iterate and improve. What's important is small actions made consistently.

There seem to be a couple variations on the `100DaysOf` projects at this point.
If I understand correctly, the initial idea was related to `100DaysOfCode` and
was for helping new coders to develop some skill and find community.

But then there's also the [ofProjects](https://100daysofprojects.carrd.co/)
variation which was created by [Ceora Ford](https://www.ceoraford.com/) and is a
little more open to working on projects of any form. Since the guidelines are
fluid, I figured I'd make a note here for myself about the sort of requirements
I want for my own 100days...

## Constraints

In addition to the general guidelines outlined on the #100DaysOfProjects
homepage:

-   I can work on anything: be it a pull request to an open source project or
    further developments on my own site. The only requirement is that there is
    some **unit** of work that I can link to.
-   I'll add a bullet entry (if not a full page linked) here that outlines the
    outcome of each day of the challenge and link them below.
-   I will share my progress on twitter day over day and link to the current
    days page when appropriate.

## Daily Links

-   Day 00: Created a PR for `next-mdx-enhanced` to address an issue in Next
    9.5.2 and started
-   Day 01: Took my experimental mdx/next site, cloned it and put in _just
    enough_ content to have something to deploy. Got things up and running on my
    domain (`jem.dev`).
