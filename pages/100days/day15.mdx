Today I got to spend the day at a digital conference! I actually took the day
off from work entirely so I'd have the time to participate.

[The notes for today were moved over to a spot specifically for #CJS20](/conf/cascadiajs/2020/day1-notes)

<Clippings>

-   Took lots of notes during the conference
-   Chatted and connected with more folks than I expected for a digital event
