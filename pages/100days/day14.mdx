[#100DaysOfProjects](./)

Today I continued the task I had started on yesterday: looking for the most
performant way to load a directory or listing of mdx content.

## Babel glob import limitations

So I tried a couple of variations of babel importers that would allow me to
import a glob of files. My first couple of attempts didn't work great, but some
of that was likely my own misconfiguration. Still: I ran into various success
with different modules and how they offered to "glob" that data.

I like to choose modules with a high maintainability score, so after doing a
little more searching I came upon a babel-macro that would allow exporting.
Rather than over-rely on non-standard syntax, a macro seemed like a nice way of
keeping complexity low(er) and hopefully more maintainable.

## Importing a glob from a component

The macro offers a simple syncronous method that we can use to load a glob path,
and using this from within a component module I was able to successfully grab an
array of file information. Most specifically: I was looking for access to the
mdx exports so that I could pull out specific data from frontMatter.

The component that I created initially was a simple module. It only exported a
single component that showed `<li>`'s for each file (sans index) within a
hardcoded directory.

```js
// components/pages/OneHundredDays

import importAll from 'import-all.macro'
import { parse } from 'path'
import Link from 'next/link'

const files = importAll.sync('../pages/100days/*.mdx')
const postsArray = Object.keys(files)
    .filter((filePath) => {
        return !filePath.includes('index')
    })
    .map((fullPath) => {
        const pathParts = parse(fullPath)
        return pathParts.name
    })

const OneHundredDays = () => {
    return (
        <ul>
            {postsArray.map((postName) => (
                <li>
                    <Link href={`/100days/${postName}`}>{postName}</Link>
                </li>
            ))}
        </ul>
    )
}

export default OneHundredDays
```

This technically works! I could import this component and render a list of pages
with links! Job done?

Nope. Not so fast. I'm not sure if it's obvious from the example code above, but
this code will actually import the ENTIRE module for each file, and they are ALL
included as part of the `postsArray` that the component exports. If I wanted to
simply access front matter, I've now included everything, and any page that
includes this component will include the weight of ALL linked pages. This might
not be a huge issue now, but as the site grows in complexity this is growing
weight added to every page that is completely unnecessary.

Here's a few notes from the build results that illustrates some of the problem.
Note the template for `day13` where I've incluced the `<OneHundredDays />` list
component and that the first load js is much higher than the surrounding
modules. We want to be careful here, because this isn't just one time bloat: as
the list of pages available grows we start to add more and more additional
content that is unnecessary to that component.

Next.js already offers an api for pages to load `props` from data supplied
either at build or render time (via `getStaticProps` and `getServerSideProps`).
A better approach would be to use these api's to load a more focused subset of
data on a page by page basis.

In the example above: `day14` and `list-of-posts` both include the data via
`getStaticProps` which allows us to pass ONLY what is needed into the individual
page templates.

## getStaticProps with MDX

So one useful element of next pages is being able to feed in props via a couple
of additional module exports. When you render pages with mdx it's not as obvious
how you would hook into using props like this, but it's actually really useful
still for loading data ahead of time.

```js
export { getStaticProps } from 'components/getStaticProps/OneHundredDays'
```

My next site uses absolute imports (and the `baseUrl` property in tsconfig)
which allows me to put all of my components into the `/components` directory and
import them (or any other module) as though it was from that base dir. I then
create some helper modules in `components/getStaticProps` that
`export const getStaticProps =` and follow the standard nextjs pattern with that
data loading function. By then exporting the function from any of the mdx pages,
I can utilize data-pre-loading at build time.

I've included this in the head of a couple of pages so that I can load the list
of posts via static props and not have to worry about extra weight landing in
the pages. The data is loaded via props and therefore available to components
within the page that want to render based on it (but luckily avoiding the full
weight of an entire map of posts).

## Connecting static props to components

So now that we have the data fed into the page via props, what can we do to
actually render that data in a nice component within the page itself? Props are
one obvious route to pass data into a component that work easily enough.

```js
<PageList postsArray={props.postsArray} />
```

Which results in the following:

<PageList postsArray={props.postsArray} />

while keeping our overall page bundle size as minimal as possible, only
exporting the content that we actually need (not the entire contents of all the
other posts we haven't done anything with).

We'll note here that the page `day14` has a listing of all the same posts that
we include on the `100days` and `100days/day13` templates. But because we're
smarter about including these props as part of the static generation (and only
including file names that exist), we keep the overall page and it's dynamic
components still as light as possible.

## Do you want to explore?

To make it easier on myself to check this revision out in the future, I'm going
to commit my work in progress code for the day. All of this will be available on
the `main` branch for today's commit. In the future I'll clean up more of this,
but I like the idea of keeping the proof of concept for today intact.

<Clippings>

-   Switched to a new clippings component. `lower-romans` list-style-type ftw.
-   Tried rendering mdx content inside of a component (the new clippings
    component) and it works just dandy!
-   Wrapped up my tests from yesterday with a couple of data loading strategies
    that I feel okay about (documented above)
-   Discovered "Reflow" plugin for VSC. Now that I'm doing more editing of
    markdown directly, having some text flow options that hook in with my
    prettier config is extremely useful...
