Today I worked on a couple of updates to the base `_app.jsx` template. There's
not much on the page right now: almost nothing for a visual template outside of
vertically centering and applying a max-width to the content.

## Color Theme

However, I was able to update the colors to use a base theme that is more
analagous for now. (I generated the theme at coolors,
[available here](https://coolors.co/cad5a6-a4b374-8db01a-535745-666665), then
made minor adjustments to individual shades where necessary to improve color
contrast.)

## Dark Mode

I also applied a simple media query to enable a dark mode variant. (Even if we
don't have a toggle on page yet, at least the page will show up darker for folks
that use a dark system or themes.) The dark mode version will use dark hues and
automatically thin the san-serif font a little.

I also fleshed out the [`100Days`](./100days) page for tracking this project
progress. Updated some of the colors used along with a very rudimentary
dark-mode variation. Also made some tweaks so my tracking code works properly.

## Troubleshooting...

I did run into some difficulty getting the environment variables that I feed
into my client side analytics solution to map correctly. While the server side
components have access to env values easily enough, they only end up being
passed to the client side code on vercel if you make sure to prefix them
correctly.

I shifted values around a couple of times and finally found what works. My
testing consisted of various commits to a feature branch and deployed
automatically on vercel. From there I was able to make updates incrementally and
verify whether or not the values made it to the browser.

-   You can set whatever you want for the root environment variable KEYS (the
    values you'd set with real environment variables or passed from the
    environment config from vercel)
-   In `next.config.js` your environment variables are mapped.
-   You must use `.env` keys here with `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefixed to make them
    actually available to scripts.
-   Your scripts should generally refer to `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_X` directly.
    I def couldn't `console.log` the value of `process.env` directly, it was
    always undefined, so I suspect there is a loader somewhere that is
    transforming those environment values for runtime somehow...
