[#100DaysOfProjects](./)

Another notes catchup day: I started by including the day12 notes to cover my
contributions for yesterday. (I still followed the rules considering I posted to
twitter about it... I just didn't actually add a page over here until today.)

Wanting a little bit of a break I've decided to scope the new project for today
as small as possible. I want to look at what it takes to add directory lists or
pull in post data from more than just one post at a time.

## Directory Listings

When you start loading files directly via the next.js pages api, it can be
tempting to think about putting all of your posts into some sort of big array
and then handle rendering markdown remotely. This is a useful approach when you
need to render mdx from potential remote sources (where enabling imports is
potentially not feasible) but for a local website or digital garden, this is
definitely overkill.

### Babel Import Glob to the rescue

As much as it might sound like reading a directory list manually is necessary,
we can actually use babel to shortcut the process and simply import a glob of
files.
