🧑‍🏫 THE TALKS

## Evan Tahler

_How I learned to Stop Worrying and Let the Robot Publish to NPM_

-   Lots of care to ensure this wasn’t just a zoom call
-   Lots of quick releases in quick succession probably a sign something went
    wrong
-   NPM flow (vs git flow) takes metaphors from both gitflow and ci/cd
    [image:AE9B4FC2-1E3B-4A90-A8DB-0673D427B8F9-1646-00008E89C0D48620/Screen
    Shot 2020-09-02 at 09.36.11 .png]
-   `npx cascadiajs` vs `npx cascadiajs@next` _ npm packages have BOTH semver
    number and tag identifiers. _ default tag is `latest`, can tag
-   .npmignore vs .gitignore
-   get ci robot to publish code for us _ npm version command to set version
    (`[no ci]`) _ grant ci access to npm _ push to npm _ push to git
-   need a human still to trigger version changes (or semantic release)
-   don’t be afraid to make a tonne of npm packages
-   QA: \* _how do you know if something is ready to share_ _ just learn in the
    open, get started with low risk _ thought publishing to npm was high risk,
    but it’s really not \* low risk: can move tags around if you need to

Chat commentary: Brenden (Organizer) [He/him] Saw a question about some of the
tooling to help with npm flow. Check out semantic-release to help automate some
of the process https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release

_The Zen of Git_

-   Joke poem that makes light of git’s difficulty
-   touching on graph theory
-   git is a directed graph
-   (from chat: Anyone know if there is an awesome resource that describes all
    data structures in such an awesome (and/or fun/visual) way?) _
    [VisuAlgo - visualising data structures and algorithms through animation](https://visualgo.net/en)
    _ https://medium.com/basecs _ and here’s a good intro for DAGs in git:
    [Git for Computer Scientists](https://eagain.net/articles/git-for-computer-scientists/)
    _
    [Grokking Algorithms: An illustrated guide for programmers and other curious people: Bhargava, Aditya: 4708364241294: Amazon.com: Books](https://www.amazon.com/Grokking-Algorithms-illustrated-programmers-curious/dp/1617292230/ref=sr_1_1?crid=3NYDKBQBC7XT0&dchild=1&keywords=data+structures+and+algorithms+illustrated&qid=1599066222&s=books&sprefix=data+structuer%2Cstripbooks%2C206&sr=1-1) \*
    Also, for sorting algoritms with dance:
    https://www.youtube.com/user/AlgoRythmics/videos
-   From chat: Another cool way to understand how git stores information is to
    play with GitHub’s GraphQL API.
-   Iterating through example of how git works, generating blobs with headers
    and hashes
-   signpost for commits (branch name) taken along with you as you add commits
    to a tree
-   HEAD tells you “where you are”. usually points at a branch, works like a
    branch. literally a file that tells you branch or commit name
-   what if you have two branches on same commit? head tells you which.
-   tags just stay at a commit. also remote branches. just meta data on the
    graph (references as opposed to “objects on the graph”)
-   how does a merge work? how does rebase work? (demonstrated example)
-   from chat: when talking through ‘fun’ scenarios in git with teammates, I
    find a picture is helpful. Found this (interactive) tool recently which lets
    you recreate specific scenarios to talk through.
    https://git-school.github.io/visualizing-git/#cherry-pick
-   checkout: can move around in time or on graph
-   ✨this talk needs to be watched again (and again)✨

## Scott Ammon

_Musical Creativity in the Browser_

-   Midi: Musical instrument digital interface \* doesn’t transmit audio! just
    the physical actions
-   web midi api: low level interface, incl data key with physical action.
-   show an example of sockets over server less (with the caveat that
    instruments could be received out of order)
-   really cool visualization attached to the notes played
-   https://tonejs.github.io/
-   QA discussion notes from chat: _ EWI!
    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5u1GS4R_EfI _ Steve Kinney’s talk from
    SeattleJS a few years ago used his lib to make more “human” music interfaces
    easier: https://github.com/stevekinney/octavian

## Pantelis Kalogiros

[Complex Geometry in HTML! A story of Constrained Creativity](https://2020.cascadiajs.com/speakers/pantelis-kalogiros)

Hey everybody!! If you want to see the finished game/tech demo of my talk click
here -> https://pantel.is/projects/css3d/ (rendering is all in css3d/html, of
course a ton of vanilla js is used too for the actual gameplay) (edited)

-   Constrained creativity: constraints breed creativity \* (short story
    “Computer, did we bring batteries? Computer?” 😅 )
-   Some amazing demos of putting components into perspective, rendering full 3d
    scenes (my notes would not do it justice)
-   Are there libraries that make this easier? _ The math hasn’t changed _ Can
    use Three.js: will render without web-gl. SVG/Canvas and ascii rendering…
-   are there perf limitations: _ can have 700-800 faces (elements), textures
    can add up _ there are tricks you can do to avoid rendering certain elements
    (hide elements out of sight with display: none, using lower res textures)

## Amber Hoak

[SVG, Canvas, and WebGL: The Power, the Beauty, and the Cost](https://2020.cascadiajs.com/speakers/amber-hoak)

-   data visualization == communication \* (flatten the curve chart being a good
    example)
-   Wikiverse: http://wikiverse.io/
-   [GitHub - ahoak/pixi-svg-visualization: Pixi.js v5 and SVG using D3.js for example of hybrid renderers in data visualizations](https://github.com/ahoak/pixi-svg-visualization)

-   Amber shared links and talk timings in the public slack as we watched
-   [10 Things Everyone Hates About You](https://pudding.cool/2017/12/hater/)
-   I am going over this section pretty quickly but in the benchmark code you
    can see how you can use this for real:

    https://github.com/ahoak/pixi-svg-visualization/blob/main/src/components/Chart/Pixi/PixiRenderer.ts
-   For non-data visualization uses, we can mix HTML and webGL together to
    create interesting effects such as this “distortion effect”.

## Dan McKeon

[How I Graduated from React to Vanilla JavaScript](https://2020.cascadiajs.com/speakers/dan-mckeon)

-   Talking about his process going from react back toward vanilla js
-   Core dom api’s like querySelector
-   addEventListener but forgetting to remove it and ending up with a memory
    leak
-   discussion of uses for a11y
-   Resources: _ [mdn web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) _
    [google web fundamentals](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals) \*
    [aria authoring practices](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/)

> jQuery bundled a few important concepts together that really made it sing: DOM
> selectors, chainable utility interface, plugin ecosystem, and reusable common
> factory pattern… we now have the advantage of using each of these features
> independently (querySeleector, underscore/lodash, npm/esm, ESNext+): it’s one
> of the best stories where its success lead to its own demise [James Vivian
> [he/him]]

> i swear if i got a dollar for every \$ i had to write i’d have enough to buy a
> couple avocado toasts by now [melody (they/them)

> React to vanilla: Looks like someone did it… and documented it.

-   July 17th 1936: first nbc live broadcast

    no knowledge of the medium yet
-   there is an analog here in how cascadia has embraced this distributed format
    this year
-   “third age of javascript” [@swyx](https://www.swyx.io/writing/js-third-age/)
-   affiliated with snowpack, pika, skypack

## Carter and Jessica Closing

-   Made a choice not to use Remo / Hop.in (directly anyways)
-   Believe their are pillars of cascadia, feeling the warmth of audience
-   Emotes feature was a way for audience interaction
-   Having proper captioning: we do this already
-   “we’re web developers: this conference is about the web” empowered idea of
    building things modular, distribute work
-   rambly: digital 8bit world for discussion
-   remo: being able to sit down at tables with folks
-   “You can’t collect Pokemon if you’re a jerk” ⬅ I need to cross-stitch this
