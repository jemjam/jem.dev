# Cascadia Day 02

Heroku created a bunch of open source tools to help facilitate the conference.

(side note: cassidoo recommended this keep to someone and I just wanted to keep
note of it:

_How I learned to Stop Worrying and Let the Robot Publish to NPM_

-   Lots of care to ensure this wasn’t just a zoom call
-   Lots of quick releases in quick succession probably a sign something went
    wrong
-   NPM flow (vs git flow) takes metaphors from both gitflow and ci/cd

-   `npx cascadiajs` vs `npx cascadiajs@next` _ npm packages have BOTH semver
    number and tag identifiers. _ default tag is `latest`, can tag
-   .npmignore vs .gitignore
-   get ci robot to publish code for us _ npm version command to set version
    (`[no ci]`) _ grant ci access to npm _ push to npm _ push to git
-   need a human still to trigger version changes (or semantic release)
-   don’t be afraid to make a tonne of npm packages
-   QA: \* _how do you know if something is ready to share_ _ just learn in the
    open, get started with low risk _ thought publishing to npm was high risk,
    but it’s really not \* low risk: can move tags around if you need to

Chat commentary: Brenden (Organizer) [He/him] Saw a question about some of the
tooling to help with npm flow. Check out semantic-release to help automate some
of the process https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release

_The Zen of Git_

-   Joke poem that makes light of git’s difficulty
-   touching on graph theory
-   git is a directed graph
-   (from chat: Anyone know if there is an awesome resource that describes all
    data structures in such an awesome (and/or fun/visual) way?) _
    [VisuAlgo - visualising data structures and algorithms through animation](https://visualgo.net/en)
    _ https://medium.com/basecs _ and here’s a good intro for DAGs in git:
    [Git for Computer Scientists](https://eagain.net/articles/git-for-computer-scientists/)
    _
    [Grokking Algorithms: An illustrated guide for programmers and other curious people: Bhargava, Aditya: 4708364241294: Amazon.com: Books](#) \*
    Also, for sorting algoritms with dance:
    https://www.youtube.com/user/AlgoRythmics/videos
-   From chat: Another cool way to understand how git stores information is to
    play with GitHub’s GraphQL API.
-   Iterating through example of how git works, generating blobs with headers
    and hashes
-   signpost for commits (branch name) taken along with you as you add commits
    to a tree
-   HEAD tells you “where you are”. usually points at a branch, works like a
    branch. literally a file that tells you branch or commit name
-   what if you have two branches on same commit? head tells you which.
-   tags just stay at a commit. also remote branches. just meta data on the
    graph (references as opposed to “objects on the graph”)
-   how does a merge work? how does rebase work? (demonstrated example)
-   from chat: when talking through ‘fun’ scenarios in git with teammates, I
    find a picture is helpful. Found this (interactive) tool recently which lets
    you recreate specific scenarios to talk through.
    https://git-school.github.io/visualizing-git/#cherry-pick
-   checkout: can move around in time or on graph
-   ✨this talk needs to be watched again (and again)✨

_Musical Creativity in the Browser_

-   Midi: Musical instrument digital interface \* doesn’t transmit audio! just
    the physical actions
-   web midi api: low level interface, incl data key with physical action.
-   show an example of sockets over server less (with the caveat that
    instruments could be received out of order)
-   really cool visualization attached to the notes played
-   https://tonejs.github.io/
-   QA discussion notes from chat: _ EWI!
    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5u1GS4R_EfI _ Steve Kinney’s talk from
    SeattleJS a few years ago used his lib to make more “human” music interfaces
    easier: https://github.com/stevekinney/octavian
