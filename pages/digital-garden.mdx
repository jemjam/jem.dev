Hi, my name is Jem, and I'm working on a digital garden.

A digital garden is kind of like a personal blog or website, but it's meant to
grow more ogranically. The core idea (as I understand it) is you post early and
often, and iterate on your content continually. Over time the good stuff grows,
and you weed out the junk.

## 100 Days of Projects

Cultivating this space is officially my first `100DaysOfProjects` project. Small
increments every day for the next 100 days (and beyond).
